and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- `enable_cs` removed due to soundness hole when interacting with `Clone` and
  `interrupt::free`.

## [v0.2.2] - 2020-04-23

### Changed
- All uses of the `asm!` macro have been replace with `llvm_asm!`, in
accordance with [Issue 70173](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70173).

### Removed
- `deny(warnings)` lint, as it's too restrictive.

## [v0.2.1] - 2020-04-23

### Added
- Add `enable_cs(_cs: CriticalSection)` function, which safely enable
interrupts by consuming a `CriticalSection` token. Because the token is
consumed, it is not possible to enable interrupts using `enable_cs` while
inside an `interrupt::free` critical section.

## [v0.2.0] - 2019-12-26

### Added
- CI Support

### Changed
- Updated [bare-metal] to 0.2.x. This crate's API is source-compatible with
0.1.0, but using bare_metal v0.2.x causes incompatible type errors with device
crates (PACs) using [bare-metal] v0.1.x. This requires a major version bump to
fix.

## v0.1.0 - 2017-07-22

Initial release.
